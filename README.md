# Sappho-Magazine
Sappho magazine page-specific metadata and Palladio network text file, made for DH master's dissertation project.

This project is an open-access reproducible experiment, creating descriptive metadata from Sappho magazine (1972-81). The metadata created can be viewed as two spreadsheets showing issue information and page information, with table headings directing what is recorded. For more information detailing the files, please see the Sappho Metadata Schema.

Access the magazine through Glasgow Women's Library, or Gale Primary Sources. https://www.gale.com/intl/c/archives-of-sexuality-and-gender-lgbtq-part-ii https://archive.womenslibrary.org.uk/sappho-archive-2

Please use and explore both this data and Sappho magazine, but if using any work uploaded here, cite accurately 'Eleanor Newton' as author, and the GitHub link to the data.
